# Valve Map Format 2006 Importer for [Chisel Editor](https://github.com/RadicalCSG/Chisel.Prototype).

This Unity package allows you to import VMF map files into Chisel as editable brushes. This means that once the import is complete, you can continue editing the level directly in the Unity Editor using tools similar to Hammer.

## Installation Instructions:

## References:

This importer was originally created for the [SabreCSG](https://github.com/sabresaurus/SabreCSG) project, but development now continues only for Chisel. The parser is also available [here](https://github.com/Henry00IS/CSharp/tree/master/Proprietary/ValveMapFormat2006) in regular C# without Unity dependencies.
